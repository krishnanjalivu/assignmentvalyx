This project has 2 folders a server and frontend.the server folder is to connect to backend and we need to install dependencies node express mongoose and i have connected to atlas .and for frontend install axios.i have used vite so you have to install necessary dependencies it will be there in package json.and run npm run dev.

ps:there were lot of error while doing this project especially while fetching the data from the backend.so if you have time just go through this or else you can go with other candidate.anyway it was nice doing this assignment and i have learned a lot.
